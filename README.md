TL;DR This project is a basic blog application built using Flask.

Alright, another python project to continue leveling up in both python and the micro framework Flask. In my previous python project, I implemented routing, created a basic template, and extended the template along with corresponding routes. I think the deliverables for this new project is the next step up to becoming more proficient in developing with python. For this project, I will be following along with the tutorial provided by the official Flask documentation which one can access over at https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/. The end product will be a simple Tumblr clone. Users will be able to register, log in, and perform basic CRUD on their blogs. Small personal design tweaks will be implemented here and there. Any major feature changes different from the tutorial will be noted as such.

First goal: Project setup
Second goal: Database setup
Third goal: Authorization blueprint
Fourth goal: Create templates for render template function
Fifth goal: Add basic styling
Sixth goal: Blog blueprint
Seventh goal: Making the project installable elsewhere
